# Health_Analytics_Mini_Case_Study
We have just received an urgent request from the General Manager of Analytics at Health Co requesting our assistance with their analysis. The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they cannot fix!

In this case study I will debug their SQL script and then use the resulting query outputs to answer a few analytics questions requested by the General Manager:

Questions that we need to help the GM answer:
1. How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
3. What about the median number of measurements per user?
4. How many users have 3 or more measurements?
5. How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?
7. Have logged blood glucose measurements?
8. Have at least 2 types of measurements?
9. Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?
10.What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?
